                                    BuzzFizz
Given an array, determine if it is a correct FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to the last item in the array. A sequence is correct if:

Numbers that are multiples of 3 are replaced with "Fizz"
Numbers that are multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz"
Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz"
All other numbers remain as integers in ascending order, starting from 1.
The array must start at 1 and have no missing or extra elements.
