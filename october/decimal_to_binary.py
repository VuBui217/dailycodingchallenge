Decimal to Binary
Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert 12 to binary:

12 รท 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1

def to_binary(decimal):
    binary = []
    if decimal == 0:
        return '0'
    while decimal > 0:
        remainder = decimal % 2
        binary.append(str(remainder))
        decimal = decimal // 2
    return ''.join(binary[::-1])



print(to_binary(5))  # should return "101"
